# User-Profile-with-Dynamic-Search

Overview of Search Functionality

The project allows users to search through a list of user profiles based on their names.

1. Enter a search query in the input field labeled "Enter Username..."

2. As you type, the list of user profiles will dynamically update to display only those profiles whose names match the entered search query.

3. The search is case-insensitive, meaning it will match names regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters.

4. It matches against both first and last names of users. For example, searching for "Michael" or "Lawson" will display users with those names in any order.

5. The search functionality enables users to quickly find specific user profiles from the list without manually scrolling through the entire list.
